   - 1/2 cup maple syrup (as a healthier alternative to honey)

**Preparation Instructions:**

1. **Vegetarian Moussaka:**
   - Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
   - Lightly salt the eggplant slices and let them sit for about 20 minutes to draw out moisture. Rinse and pat dry.
   - In a skillet, sauté the onion and garlic until soft. Add cooked lentils and stir in tomato sauce, cinnamon, oregano, salt, pepper, and vegetable broth. Simmer for 20 minutes.
   - In a saucepan, heat olive oil, whisk in flour, and gradually add milk, stirring continuously until thickened. Remove from heat and stir in beaten eggs or silken tofu.
   - Arrange half of the eggplant slices in a baking dish. Layer the lentil sauce, remaining eggplant, and top with the white sauce. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese or nutritional yeast on top.
   - Bake for 45 minutes or until golden brown.

2. **Greek Salad:**
   - In a large bowl, combine tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, onion, olives, and feta cheese or tofu feta.
   - In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper.
   - Pour dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine.

3. **Baklava:**
   - Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
   - Butter or oil a 9x13 inch baking dish. Layer 8 sheets of phyllo in the dish, brushing each with melted butter or oil.
   - Combine walnuts and cinnamon; sprinkle a portion over the phyllo. Repeat layers, finishing with 8 sheets of phyllo.
   - Cut into diamond shapes, bake for 50 minutes.
   - In a saucepan, boil sugar, water, maple syrup, vanilla, and lemon zest for about 10 minutes.
   - Pour syrup over the hot baklava and let it cool completely before serving.

**Serving Suggestions:**

- Serve the Vegetarian Moussaka hot, directly from the oven, with a side of Greek salad for freshness and balance.
- Present the Greek salad in a large bowl or platter, allowing guests to serve themselves.
- Cut the cooled Baklava into pieces and serve on a decorative plate or platter as a delightful sweet ending to the meal.
